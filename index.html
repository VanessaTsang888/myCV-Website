<!--
My First HTML website: my CV

1. create boilerplate (a code template that can be reused) code, we use the Emmet plugin we can write html and hit Enter key. If that don't work try the tab key after writing HTML,
or typing an exclamation Mark then the tab or enter key.

Emphasis the paragraph text: <em></em> tag.

To create a gap between img and text I need to add some cellspacing to the table element.
