# My CV Website

My curriculum vitae website is one of my personal projects that I've been working on around my day job as UI Engineer. Now published using [GitHub Pages](https://vanessatsang888.github.io/myCV-Website)

## About

The purpose of developing my own CV website is to enhance my HTML5 & CSS2/3 skills and to develop my own online CV website that can be easily maintained and published online.

This CV website is one of my personal projects that I have been working on around my day job as a UI Software Engineer on various government projects. Please note that I have NOT published any of my commercial projects within my software enginnering work as they are of sensitive nature (government/defence/national security projects). However, in the near future, I will be able to include a link to a commercial project (within my responsive portfolio website) that I've worked on as this is a public facing and dynamic portal application that allows users to apply for a government grant online efficiently, reducing most of the paperwork for the customer and better control of the 'climate change issue' that the whole world is currently facing.
