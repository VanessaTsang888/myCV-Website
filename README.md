# myCV-Website
My curriculum vitae website application now published using GitHub Pages: https://vanessatsang888.github.io/myCV-Website


## About
So far I have used **HTML5** at intermediate level to develop the content and structure of my cv website application.
The plan is to use CSS2/3 (with Boostrap) to apply the style by creating a new external CSS file. Then I will use JavaScript ES6 to add some behaviour to my website.

### The Purpose
The purpose of creating my own cv website application is:
- It was in summer 2019 that I had a training in using HTML5 & CSS2/3 and developing this web app will not only refresh my memory but also help me upskill in these languages.
- It was in April 2019 that I had a little training in using Bootstrap and developing this web app will not only refresh my memory but also help me upskill in Bootstrap.
- Although I had some JavaScript training in January 2021, developing this web app will help develop my JavaScript skills even further.
- Since I am looking for a new job in website development or software development, developing this web app will help me gain a job as a Frontend Developer.

### HTML5 Concepts Covered
So far the HTML concepts that I have covered in my web app are:
1. Lists (bullet and number lists)
2. Image element
3. Links and Anchor Tags
4. Tables and tables for layout
5. Forms

### How To Use This Web App
Simply double click on the: index.html (homepage)file and this will launch my web app in your deafult browser. At the bottom of that page you will see two hyperlinks. The first link will take you to a page that has some information on my Achievements, Hobbies and Interests. The second link will take you to the Contact Me page where you will find a HTML Form.
